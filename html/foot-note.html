     <p>For the purposes of this tool, the default insurance premium figure is based on a premium rate of 3.60% of the mortgage amount, which is the rate applicable to a loan-to-value ratio of 90.01% â€“ 95.00%. However, the insurance rate for your scenario may be higher or lower than this, which would normally result in a higher or lower insurance premium, respectively. Current premium rates may be found at https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/moloin/moloin_005.cfm.<br>
     A maximum purchase price that is over $1,000,000 will use 20% minimum down payment for illustrative purposes, however a higher percentage may be required by your lender. Speak to your lender for exact amount.</p>
